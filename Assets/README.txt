To comply with Unity's Asset Store requirements, this package is slightly different from the one at https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/unity:
1) It does not contain the Standard Assets. Please get them from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-32351
2) All assets have been moved to a new folder hierarchy under Assets/Oculus. Please move the StreamingAssets folder from Assets/Oculus/SampleFramework/ to Assets/ before using the Movie Player sample.
